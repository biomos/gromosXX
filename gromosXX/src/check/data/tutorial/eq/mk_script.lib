TITLE
Library file for templates to be used with the program mkscript
END
#
# This file defines some templates to be used with the program mkscript
# so that it will write out a script that conforms to your personal wishes
# regarding filenames and that it can be used on different architectures
# A template is a generalized string, where part of the string can be treated
# as variables. When running the program the filenames will then always have 
# the same structure. In the template a variable is marked as being in between
# %-signs
# Variables that are supported are
#    %system%  --  the system name as provided with the input flag @sys
#    %number%  --  the sequential job number
#    %start_time% -- the initial time of the simulation
#    %end_time%   -- the time at the end of the simulation
#    %queue       -- the queue to run as specified by the input flag @queue
#
FILENAMES
#
# This block allows you to set the templates for several file names
# supported types are
#    script   -- the script that is generated
#                default: jmd%system%_%number%.sh
#    input    -- input files that are generated
#                also used as the input name in continuation scripts
#                default: imd%system%_%number%.dat
#    output   -- the output file
#                default: omd%system%_%number%.out
#    coord    -- a coordinates file
#                default: o%system%sxmd_%number%.dat
#    outtrx   -- the trajectory file 
#                (only used if specified in the WRITE block)
#                default: o%system%trmd_%number%.dat
#    outtrv   -- the velocity trajectory file
#                (only used if specified in the WRITE block)
#                default: o%system%tvmd_%number%.dat
#    outtre   -- the energy trajectory file
#                (only used if specified in the WRITE block)
#                default: o%system%temd_%number%.dat
#    outtrg   -- the free energy trajectory file
#                (only used if specified in the WRITE block)
#                default: o%system%tgmd_%number%.dat
#    and all input-file names. If a file is needed but not specified, the 
#    program will try to open it according to the template. Exceptions are
#    the topology and the input file which you really have to specify.
# 
# TYPE   TEMPLATE
script  %system%_%number%.run
input   %system%_%number%.imd
output  %system%_%number%.omd
coord   %system%_%number%.cnf
outtrx  %system%_%number%.trc
outtrv  %system%_%number%.trv
outtre  %system%_%number%.tre
outtrg  %system%_%number%.trg
END
MISCELLANEOUS
#
# This block allows you to set some features in the script
# supported types are
#    workdir     -- a (local) directory where the job is run
#                   it will be created and removed by the script
#                   default: /scrloc/${USER}_%system%_%number%
#    lastcommand -- a final command that can be used to submit the
#                   next job. The default template knows about most
#                   igc-queues and takes a redefinition of the template
#                   that determines the script name into account
#                   default: depending on the queue: 
#                      e.g.: ssub -s moose <script template>
#                   
# TYPE      TEMPLATE
workdir     \$\{SIMULDIR\}
lastcommand ./%system%_%number%.run
END
LINKADDITION
#
# This block allows you to add extra fortran links as input or output units
# supported types are
#    input  -- the file is assumed to be in the directory specified by the 
#              @dir flag and linked to fort.LINK
#    output -- the file is linked to fort.LINK, will be gzipped and copied to
#              the directory specified by the @dir flag.
#
# TYPE   TEMPLATE                      LINK
