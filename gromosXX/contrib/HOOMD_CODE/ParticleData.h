/*! Once acquired, the user of the ParticleData gets access to the data arrays

	Assumptions that the user of this data structure can make:
		- None of the arrays alias each other
		- No other code will be accessing these arrays in parallel (data arrays can
			only be acquired once at a time).
		- All particles are inside the box (see BoxDim)
		- Each rtag element refers uniquely to a single particle (care should be taken
			by the user not to to clobber this)
			
	More importantly, there are some assumptions that cannot be made:
		- Data may be in a different order next time the arrays are acquired
		- Pointers may be in a different location in memory next time the arrays are acquired
		- Anything updating these arrays CANNOT move particles outside the box
		
	\note Most of the data structures store properties for each particle. For example
		  x[i] is the c-coordinate of particle i. The one exception is the rtag array.
		  Instead of rtag[i] being the tag of particle i, rtag[tag] is the index i itself.
		  
	Values in the type array can range from 0 to ParticleData->getNTypes()-1.

//! Manages all of the data arrays for the particles
/*! ParticleData stores and manages particle coordinates, velocities, accelerations, type,
	and tag information. This data must be available both via the CPU and GPU memories. 
	All copying of data back and forth from the GPU is accomplished transparently. To access
	the particle data for read-only purposes: call acquireReadOnly() for CPU access or 
	acquireReadOnlyGPU() for GPU access. Similarly, if any values in the data are to be 
	changed, data pointers can be gotten with: acquireReadWrite() for the CPU and 
	acquireReadWriteGPU() for the GPU. A single ParticleData cannot be acquired multiple
	times without releasing it. Call release() to do so. An assert() will fail in debug 
	builds if the ParticleData is acquired more than once without being released.
	
	For performance reasons, data is stored as simple arrays. Once ParticleDataArrays 
	(or the const counterpart) has been acquired, the coordinates of the particle with
	<em>index</em> \c i can be accessed with <code>arrays.x[i]</code>, <code>arrays.y[i]</code>,
	and <code>arrays.z[i]</code> where \c i runs from 0 to <code>arrays.nparticles</code>.
	
	Velocities can similarly be accessed through the members vx,vy, and vz
	
	\warning Particles can and will be rearranged in the arrays throughout a simulation.
	So, a particle that was once at index 5 may be at index 123 the next time the data
	is acquired. Individual particles can be tracked through all these changes by their tag.
	<code>arrays.tag[i]</code> identifies the tag of the particle that currently has index
	\c i, and the index of a particle with tag \c tag can be read from <code>arrays.rtag[tag]</code>.
	
	In order to help other classes deal with particles changing indices, any class that 
	changes the order must call notifyParticleSort(). Any class interested in being notified
	can subscribe to the signal by calling connectParticleSort().
	
	\note When writing to the particle data, particles must not be moved outside the box.
	In debug builds, any aquire will fail an assertion if this is done.
