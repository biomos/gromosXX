//! Performs computations on ParticleData structures
/*! The Compute is an abstract concept that performs some kind of computation on the
	particles in a ParticleData structure. This computation is to be done by reading
	the particle data only, no writing. Computes will be used to generate neighbor lists,
	calculate forces, and calculate temperatures, just to name a few.
	
	For performance and simplicity, each compute is associated with a ParticleData
	on construction. ParticleData pointers are managed with reference counted boost::shared_ptr.
	Since each ParticleData cannot change size, this allows the Compute to preallocate 
	any data structures that it may need.
	
	Computes may be referenced more than once and may reference other computes. To prevent
	uneeded data from being calculated, the time step will be passed into the compute
	method so that it can skip caculations if they have already been done this timestep.
	For convenience, the base class will provide a shouldCompute() method that implements
	this behaviour. Derived classes can override if more complicated behavior is needed.

	See \ref page_dev_info for more information
