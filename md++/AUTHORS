GROMOS is an acronym of the GROningen MOlecular Simulation computer program 
package, which has been developed since 1978 for the dynamic modelling of 
(bio)molecules, until 1990 at the University of Groningen, The Netherlands, and since then at the ETH, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, in Zürich, 
Switzerland. 
Its development was driven by the research group of Wilfred van Gunsteren 
(http://www.igc.ethz.ch). Currently, the development is shared between him and 
the research groups of Philippe Hünenberger (http://www.csms.ethz.ch) and 
Sereina Riniker (http://www.riniker.ethz.ch) at the ETH, of Chris Oostenbrink 
(http://www.map.boku.ac.at/mms/) at the University of Natural Resources and 
Life Sciences in Vienna, Austria, and of Niels Hansen 
(http://www.itt.uni-stuttgart.de/en/institute/team/staff/Hansen/) at the University of Stuttgart, Germany.
